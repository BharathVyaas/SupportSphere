# SupportSphere

SupportSphere is a Fundraising Website built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Concept

SupportSphere aims to store and showcase various campaigns and events, emphasizing connectivity between them. The project uses React.js, JavaScript, CSS, and Tailwind CSS to present campaigns in a creative and user-friendly manner.

## About SupportSphere

SupportSphere gathers comprehensive information about campaigns and users to provide additional services such as subscriptions and comments. The architecture is designed with flexibility in mind, making it easy to customize features. The use of events ensures seamless communication between components.

## Code Readability

The application prioritizes code readability, featuring well-organized components with clear separation of concerns. Design patterns and file structures make components and services modular, allowing easy adjustments by passing different values.

## Key Topics

### Responsiveness

SupportSphere achieves a high level of responsiveness by using eventEmitter from mitt to emit custom sizes. This approach ensures that pages receive tailored code, enhancing the website's responsiveness beyond standard tailwindcss capabilities.

### Optimized Code

The application is highly optimized, utilizing design patterns and conventions. It also employs lodash's debounce to prevent unnecessary rerendering, improving overall performance.

### Documentation
